    <p>This air fryer recipe is simple, delicious, and really good if you just need something low-effort but satisfying. Topped with gelato, whipped cream, and a drizzle of melted chocolate.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>5 pieces pre-cut refrigerated chocolate chip cookie dough</li>
      <li>1 scoop vanilla gelato (optional)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons whipped cream, or as needed (optional)</li>
      <li>1 ounce chocolate, melted, to drizzle (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the air fryer to 360 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>Get a large piece of aluminum foil and fold it into an 8x8-inch square. You can make a little dish out of the foil by folding the edges upward.</li>
      <li>Place 1 piece of cookie dough in the middle of your foil. Arrange remaining cookie dough pieces around it in a pattern similar to the 5-side of a die.</li>
      <li>Bake cookie in the air fryer for 6 minutes. Open the air fryer and gently push down the top of the cookie; continue to bake until deep golden brown, 2 to 4 minutes more.</li>
      <li>Add gelato, whipped cream, and a drizzle of melted chocolate, and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
